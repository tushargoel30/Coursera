P1-A-ordering:
	Implemented the solution of dining philospher problem using Strict ordering method
	without utilising scheduling primitives. Array of Threads representing philosophers. arr_fork =1 
      represent fork unoccupied arr_fork =0 represents fork occupied.


P2-A-semaphore:
	Adopted the use of a semaphore variable to implement the solution 
	to the dining philospher problem. an array of threads is created to show philosophers.



P1-B-ordering:
	Implemented the solution of modified dining philospher problem using Strict ordering method
	without utilising scheduling primitives.Arrat of Threads representing philosphers. arr_fork =1 represent fork unoccupied 
	arr_fork =0 represent fork occupied.


P1-B-semaphore:
	Adopted the use of a semaphore variable to implement the solution 
	to the modified dining philospher problem. an array of threads is created to show philosophers
	and an array of semaphore variables is used to show forks.
